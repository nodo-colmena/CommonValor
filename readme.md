## Why

This interoperability can be a natural, understandable and simple entrance for masses into the blockchain 'real world' social interaction context, ie, bridging these blockchains is a natural action due to the social nature of people. 


## Proof-of-Brain (PoB) + Proof-of-Cooperation (PoC)

Philantrophist Economy and organizations of Solidarity Economy are centred on the valorisation of the human being and not on the prioritisation of capital and **they're rarely incentiviced**, this leaded to a slow growth of the value they where creating. In this sense, FairCoop is a global Cooperative that uses FairCoin to exchange and create Value focused on organizations of Solidarity Economy and the Economics of Philanthropy; togetheer these Blockchains (Steem-Faircoin) can enhace these activities.

## Vision and Steem Mining Value

This approach (Faircoin+Steem resourses) can be together a very friendly layer for people to interact with blockchain in an usual form, because the philantropist activities of individuals are going to have more incentives, in contrast with the old unpaid volunteering. The flow of money and reliance on public funds can increase...
