## About Common Valor

Common Valor is a web application that uses the Steem ecosystem to reward activism with generation of quality content. It also incorporates an Exchange of Steem-Faircoin.

Common Valor uses Vue.js in frontend and Laravel in Backend taking advantage of the ease of integration of these 2 frameworks.

## Install and Building

The project uses the default Laravel Homestead configuration through Vagrant but you can use your own virtual environment or work with your own computer resources. 

Homestead helps to save time used in configuring the Backend tools for the development of the project.



## What do you need?

- **[PHP > 7](http://php.net/manual/es/intro-whatis.php)**

- **[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)**

- **[Vagrant - Homestead (optional)](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/homestead)**

- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)**

- **[Vue with npm](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html/)**


Once your virtual environment has been defined and installed, you can clone this repository into your virtual container. 

<h3>Type in the console</h3>

```
$ cd DAppCommonValor/
$ vagrant up (optional)
$ composer install 
$ npm install 
$ npm run dev
```

### Note
If you use vagrant and homestead you may have to configure the file /etc/hosts with the domain name "commonvalor.org.test" or you can modify the file .env and .env.example inside the folder of your homestead virtual server.

## Why

This interoperability can be a natural, understandable and simple entrance for masses into the blockchain 'real world' social interaction context, ie, bridging these blockchains is a natural action due to the social nature of people. 


## Proof-of-Brain (PoB) + Proof-of-Cooperation (PoC)

Philantrophist Economy and organizations of Solidarity Economy are centred on the valorisation of the human being and not on the prioritisation of capital and **they're rarely incentiviced**, this leaded to a slow growth of the value they where creating. In this sense, FairCoop is a global Cooperative that uses FairCoin to exchange and create Value focused on organizations of Solidarity Economy and the Economics of Philanthropy; togetheer these Blockchains (Steem-Faircoin) can enhance these activities.

## Vision and Steem Mining Value

This approach (Faircoin+Steem resourses) can be together a very friendly layer for people to interact with blockchain in an usual form, because the Philantropist, Activist and Solidarity activities of individuals are going to have more incentives, in contrast with the old unpaid volunteering. The flow of money and reliance on public funds can increase...
